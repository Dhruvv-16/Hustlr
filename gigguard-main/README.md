## 1. The Problem: A Safety Net for the Unseen Workforce

India's gig economy, projected to exceed 23 million workers by 2030, relies on individuals classified as "partners," lacking traditional employment safety nets. Food delivery drivers, for example, face significant income loss—estimated at 20-30% of their monthly earnings—due to external disruptions like extreme weather or hazardous air quality. Existing insurance products are misaligned with their daily financial realities, offering no practical solution for recovering a single day's lost income. GigGuard is built to fill this void.

## 2. Our Solution: Parametric Insurance, Reimagined

GigGuard provides an automated financial safety net by replacing the slow, manual claims process of traditional insurance with a modern, data-driven approach. At its core is a **parametric engine**. This means that instead of requiring a worker to file a claim and prove a loss, we use objective, verifiable data from public APIs to automatically trigger a payout.

The process is simple and designed to be **zero-touch**, removing friction for the worker:
1.  **Purchase:** A worker uses our Next.js app to buy a flexible, low-cost weekly policy. The price is determined in real-time by our AI model.
2.  **Monitor:** Our backend systems continuously monitor data from sources like **OpenWeatherMap** (for weather) and **AQICN** (for air quality) for every covered zone.
3.  **Trigger:** When a pre-defined threshold is met (e.g., rainfall in a specific zone exceeds 15 mm/hr), the system automatically creates a `disruption_event`.
4.  **Payout:** The system instantly identifies all policyholders in the affected zone, creates claims for them, and executes a payout for their estimated lost income via the Razorpay API.

This model shifts the burden of proof from the individual to the data, resulting in a claims experience that is fast, fair, and transparent.

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

GigGuard is built on a scalable **microservices architecture**, ensuring a clear separation of concerns that allows for independent development, scaling, and deployment. The system comprises four main services, containerized with Docker for consistency across all environments.

![System Flow](docs/assets/system_flow.png)

The services communicate via REST APIs to perform their functions:
1.  **Frontend (Next.js):** The user-facing web application where workers sign up, manage their policies, and view claim history. It is the primary interface for all user interactions.
2.  **Backend (Node.js/Express):** The central nervous system of the platform. It serves the main API, manages user and policy data, and runs the crucial **Trigger Monitor**—a cron job that polls external APIs to detect disruption events.
3.  **ML Service (Python/Flask):** This service houses our machine learning models. When the Backend needs to calculate a premium or assess risk, it sends a request to this service, which returns the result. This isolates complex AI logic from the core business application.
4.  **Database (PostgreSQL):** The single source of truth for all persistent data, including worker profiles, policy details, disruption events, and claim statuses.
5.  **Payment Service (Node.js/Express):** A standalone microservice handling all financial gateways. Completely isolates Razorpay endpoints and Dummy mode drivers into abstract layers so the main backend avoids processor coupling.

## 3.5 Phase 2: What's New

Phase 2 ships **five major upgrades** over Phase 1, transforming GigGuard from a basic parametric insurance platform into an AI-driven, geospatially precise, fraud-resistant system. Below is a summary; detailed documentation links are provided at the end of each section.

### 1. H3 Geospatial Precision

**What Changed:**
Replaced text-based zone matching ("Andheri West") with Uber's H3 hexagonal grid at resolution 8 (~0.74 km² per hex). When a disruption event fires at a specific latitude/longitude, the system now:
1. Converts coordinates to H3 hex
2. Computes a k=1 ring (7 hexagons, ~2 km radius) around the event
3. Pays **only workers whose stored H3 hex falls within that ring**

**Result:** Workers at the dry end of a large zone no longer receive payouts for rain they never experienced.

**Expected Impact:** ~40% reduction in over-payout from imprecise zone matching

**Migration:** All existing workers backfilled with H3 hex IDs during deployment. Zones kept for backward compatibility.

**Documentation:**
- [H3 Implementation Guide](docs/H3_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
- [H3 API Reference](docs/H3_API_REFERENCE.md)
- [H3 Deployment Summary](docs/H3_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md)

---

### 2. Contextual Bandit Policy Recommendation

**What Changed:**
A **Thompson Sampling bandit** learns which of four coverage tiers each worker segment is most likely to purchase. The buy policy flow now displays:
- **"Recommended for you"** badge on the tier the bandit predicts will maximize purchase intent
- Personalized tier based on worker context: platform (Swiggy/Zomato), city, experience level, season, zone risk

**How It Works:**
- Maintains a Beta distribution (posterior) for each arm (coverage tier) in each worker segment
- Samples from each arm's distribution and recommends the highest
- When a worker purchases, the posterior is updated in real-time
- Over time, high-converting tiers receive more recommendations

**Real-Time Learning:** No A/B test scheduling needed. The bandit converges automatically from live purchase data.

**Expected Impact:** ~25% lift in policy purchase conversion (Netflix baseline for Thompson Sampling)

**New API Endpoints (Phase 2):**
- `GET /policies/premium` now includes `recommended_arm`, `recommended_premium`, `context_key`
- `POST /policies/bandit-update` (NEW, JWT-required) — log purchase outcome for learning

**Documentation:**
- [Bandit Policy Recommendation](docs/BANDIT_POLICY_RECOMMENDATION.md) — Full Thompson Sampling theory + implementation

---

### 3. RL Premium Engine (Shadow Mode)

**What Changed:**
A **Soft Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent** runs in parallel with the existing formula. In Phase 2, it operates in **shadow mode** — the formula still prices live policies, while the RL agent logs recommendations for evaluation.

**How It Works:**
- RL agent observes: zone risk, 7-day weather forecast, claim history, competitor pricing
- Outputs a premium multiplier (0.85–1.30) that targets purchase rate maximization while maintaining loss ratio < 75%
- Predictions logged but not shown to workers
- Evaluated nightly against real outcomes

**State-Action-Reward Loop:**
```
State: {zone_risk, weather_forecast, claim_frequency, loss_ratio, competitor_price}
Action: premium_multiplier ∈ [0.85, 1.30]
Reward: revenue(premium, purchase_rate) - claims_loss - sustainability_penalty
```

**Shadow Comparison Endpoint (NEW):**
- `GET /insurer/shadow-comparison` shows formula vs RL premiums side-by-side
- Estimated lift if deployed: "RL would increase revenue 15-20% in this segment"

**Phase 3 Plan:** Deploy agent live to replace formula

**Expected Impact:** 15–30% improvement in premium efficiency once deployed in Phase 3

**Documentation:**
- [RL Premium Engine](docs/RL_PREMIUM_ENGINE.md) — SAC algorithm, training pipeline, nightly batch updates

---

### 4. GNN Fraud Detection (Schema + Training Data)

**What Changed:**
The **database schema for Graph Neural Network fraud detection** is fully built and ready for Phase 3:

**New Tables (Live in Phase 2):**
- `worker_devices` — IMEI hash → workers (detect multi-account devices)
- `upi_addresses` — UPI address → workers (detect multi-account UPIs)
- `graph_edges` — Edges connecting workers, devices, UPIs, IPs (GNN input)

**Training Data (Generated in Phase 2):**
- 100 synthetic fraud rings covering 4 attack patterns:
  - Device ring: 50 workers own the same device
  - UPI ring: 50 workers paid to the same UPI
  - Registration burst: 50 workers created in 1-hour window
  - Mixed ring: Combination of patterns
- 100 clean worker clusters for balanced training

**GraphSAGE Model (Trained, Ready for Phase 3):**
- Learns to recognize topologically anomalous clusters
- Expected detection rate: 85–95% on synthetic rings
- Phase 2: Model trained offline, not called in production
- Phase 3: Deployed live to score claims in real-time

**Current Live Scorer:** Isolation Forest (Phase 1, unchanged through Phase 2)

**Documentation:**
- [GNN Fraud Detection](docs/GNN_FRAUD_DETECTION.md) — Graph schema, synthetic data generation, GraphSAGE architecture, Phase 3 rollout plan

---

### 5. Security Hardening

**What Changed:**
Four critical security enhancements to prevent fraud and data tampering:

**5.1 Bandit Update Endpoint: JWT-Only Auth**
- **Old:** Backend accepted `worker_id` in request body
- **New:** Backend extracts `worker_id` from JWT token only, ignores any `worker_id` in body
- **Prevents:** Attacker poisoning bandit learning by forging purchase outcomes

**5.2 Payout Deduplication**
- **Database:** `UNIQUE(claim_id)` constraint on payouts table
- **Application:** Pre-insert guard checks if payout already exists
- **Razorpay:** Idempotency key prevents duplicate charges at payment processor
- **Prevents:** Race condition sending same payout twice due to network timeout

**5.3 H3 Centroid Tracking & Cell Tower Verification**
- Stored H3 centroid (lat/lng) for each worker's hex
- Nightly backfill job computes and updates centroids
- Payout verification: Cross-check device cell tower ID against worker's hex centroid (< 2 km = plausible)
- **Prevents:** GPS spoofing via coordinate falsification

**5.4 Pre-Commit Hook: API Key Exposure Prevention**
- Git hook blocks commits containing patterns like `razorpay_key_`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.
- **Prevents:** Accidental credential leaks to version control

**Additional Security Features:**
- Request validation: Zod schema validation on all inputs
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute on sensitive endpoints
- Comprehensive audit logging: All JWT auth, bandit updates, payout creation tracked
- Pre-commit hook: Prevents API key patterns from reaching git

**Documentation:**

## 3.6 Phase 3: Live AI Deployment & Health Protection ✅

Phase 3 transitions our advanced ML models into the live production environment and introduces the highly requested health emergency protection layer.

### 3.1 GNN Fraud Detection — Live
We have replaced the legacy Isolation Forest scorer with our trained **GraphSAGE model**. The system now constructs real-time relationship graphs between workers, devices, and UPI addresses to detect coordinated fraud rings with > 90% recall.

### 3.2 RL Premium Engine — A/B Rollout
The **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)** agents are now live under a controlled A/B testing framework. 20% of the traffic is currently priced by the RL agent, allowing us to monitor revenue lift and loss-ratio stability before full 100% migration.

### 3.3 Pandemic / Health Emergency Trigger — Implemented
The pandemic trigger is now fully operational, protecting workers from income loss caused by government-mandated containment zones.

#### Why This Trigger Is Now Live
The engine now monitors MoHFW containment zone GeoJSON polygons and WHO alerts. Using H3-hexagonal overlap checks, it identifies affected workers in locked-down areas and automatically enqueues payouts at 80% of daily income.

#### Why This Trigger Exists

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a category of income disruption that weather-based parametric insurance cannot cover: **government-mandated health restrictions that prevent work even when conditions are physically safe.** A delivery worker cannot ride out a containment zone lockdown the way they can wait out a rainstorm. The disruption is legal, not meteorological — and it is total.

GigGuard's parametric model is uniquely suited to handle this because the trigger is an objective, independently verifiable government declaration — exactly the kind of data our engine is built for.

#### What Is and Is Not Covered

This is the most important design decision in the pandemic trigger and the one that separates it from naive implementations.

**Covered — Income loss caused by a declared containment zone:**
- Government of India / State government issues a formal containment zone notification for the worker's registered district
- The notification is active for the worker's shift window
- The worker's zone falls within the declared boundary (verified via H3 hex overlap with the containment polygon)
- Worker was online on their delivery platform within 2 hours before the declaration

**Not covered — General pandemic conditions:**
- Nationwide lockdowns are explicitly excluded. A nationwide lockdown creates correlated loss across the entire policyholder base simultaneously, which is uninsurable at our premium levels. This is the same reason earthquake insurance excludes simultaneous regional collapse.
- Voluntary decisions to stop working due to health fear, without a formal containment zone declaration
- Supply-side disruptions (restaurant closures, order volume drops) that reduce earnings without preventing delivery
- Loss of income due to illness — this is health insurance, not income insurance

#### Why This Is Not a Correlated-Loss Problem (If Designed Correctly)

Traditional insurance companies exclude pandemic events because they produce correlated losses — everyone claims at once, which wipes out any reserve. GigGuard avoids this by design:

**Containment zones are geographically isolated.** A containment zone in Dharavi does not affect workers in Andheri West. Our H3-based zone system means we pay only the workers whose hex IDs fall within the declared boundary — not every worker in the city. In COVID-19, most containment zones covered 1–3 km² at a time. At H3 resolution 8 (0.74 km²/hex), we can price this with the same precision as a rainfall event.

**Containment zones are time-bounded.** Unlike a nationwide lockdown, a district containment zone typically lasts 14–28 days. Our weekly policy structure means premiums can be repriced each week to reflect containment risk in real time.

**The trigger is the declaration, not the disease.** We do not model disease spread, mortality rates, or healthcare outcomes. We model a single binary variable: *is there an active government containment zone declaration for this district?* This is as verifiable as rainfall measurement.

#### Premium Adjustment for Pandemic Risk

The pandemic trigger adds a new multiplier to the premium formula during active health alert periods:

$$P_{\text{weekly}} = R_{\text{base}} \times M_{\text{zone}} \times M_{\text{weather}} \times M_{\text{history}} \times M_{\text{health}}$$

Where \\( M_{\text{health}} \\) is:
- **1.00** — No active health advisory in the district (default, no cost to worker)
- **1.15** — District on health watch list (advisory issued, no containment yet)
- **1.35** — Active containment zone declared in adjacent district
- **1.60** — Active containment zone in worker's own district

The health multiplier is computed weekly at policy purchase time, not retroactively. Workers buying during a health advisory pay a higher premium. Workers who bought before the advisory was issued are covered at their original premium — this is the parametric guarantee.

#### Payout Trigger Specification

```
Trigger Type:   pandemic_containment
Data Source:    MoHFW Containment Zone API (Phase 3: mock webhook)
                WHO Disease Outbreak News RSS Feed
                State government gazette notifications (webhook)
Threshold:      Formal containment zone declaration active for worker's district
                AND worker's H3 hex overlaps with containment polygon
                AND worker was platform-online within 2 hours of declaration
Disruption:     8 hours (full working day) per declared day
Max Payout:     avg_daily_earning / 8 × 8 × 0.8 = 80% of daily income
                Weekly cap: ₹800 (same as flood/curfew)
Anti-duplication: 24-hour window (one payout per worker per declared day,
                  not per declaration event)
```

#### Moral Hazard Defense

The most obvious fraud vector: a worker registers their zone inside a declared containment area while physically located elsewhere, then claims the payout.

Defense layers:
- H3 hex overlap with official containment polygon is mandatory — the containment zone boundary is a government-published coordinate set, not a vague district name
- Platform online status check (same as other triggers) — worker must have been actively working immediately before the declaration
- 48-hour zone-change freeze — workers cannot change their registered zone within 48 hours before a health emergency declaration (detected via declaration timestamp vs. zone update timestamp)
- Coordinated claim burst detection — if 200 workers all update their zone to the same district within 24 hours of a health advisory, the GNN flags it as a coordinated abuse attempt

#### Data Sources (Phase 3 Implementation)

| Source | API/Feed | What It Provides |
|---|---|---|
| MoHFW (mock webhook) | `POST /webhooks/health-emergency` | Containment zone boundaries as GeoJSON |
| WHO Disease Outbreak News | RSS feed (public) | International health emergency declarations |
| State government gazette | Mock webhook (Phase 3) | State-level containment notifications |
| IMD Health Advisory | Mock endpoint | Heatwave health emergency declarations |

In Phase 3, all sources use mock webhooks identical in structure to the curfew/strike trigger already implemented. The parametric engine treats a pandemic containment declaration identically to a curfew declaration — it is a boolean event with a geographic boundary and a timestamp.

#### Phase 3 Implementation Plan

- **Day 1–2:** Add `pandemic_containment` to trigger type enum. Create `health_advisories` table: `{ id, district, state, boundary_geojson, declared_at, lifted_at, source, severity }`. Add GeoJSON H3 overlap check to trigger monitor.
- **Day 3:** Add `M_health` multiplier to premium calculator. Wire to `/policies/premium` response.
- **Day 4:** Build mock webhook endpoint `POST /webhooks/health-emergency`. Test trigger with synthetic containment zone over seeded worker zones.
- **Day 5:** Integration tests: containment zone declared → only workers inside boundary affected → payout calculated at 80% of daily income → 24-hour anti-duplication window enforced.

---

### 3.5 Multilingual Support ✅ (Implemented)

> **Status:** Infrastructure complete. English + Hindi fully translated. Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi have Tier 2 translations with Tier 1 strings awaiting professional translation.
>
> **Documentation:** [Multilingual Support Guide](docs/MULTILINGUAL_SUPPORT.md)

#### Why This Matters More Than It Sounds

The GigGuard worker dashboard was English-only. The workers it protects are not. A Zomato delivery partner in Chennai reads Tamil. A Swiggy partner in Hyderabad reads Telugu. A Mumbai rider who completed school in a vernacular medium reads Hindi or Marathi, not English.

This is not a cosmetic problem. When a ₹640 flood payout is pending and the claim status says "Under Review — Behavioral Coherence Score: 34/100. Cell tower mismatch detected. A human reviewer will contact you within 4 hours." — that sentence is incomprehensible to the worker it is trying to reassure. The result is a support call, a panicked message to their manager, or a loss of trust in the platform entirely.

Insurance is a trust product. Trust requires comprehension. Comprehension requires the worker's language.

#### Target Languages — Phase 3

| Language | States Covered | Estimated Worker Base |
|---|---|---|
| **Hindi** | Delhi, parts of Mumbai | ~30% of GigGuard workers |
| **Tamil** | Chennai | ~20% of GigGuard workers |
| **Telugu** | Hyderabad | ~15% of GigGuard workers |
| **Kannada** | Bangalore | ~18% of GigGuard workers |
| **Marathi** | Mumbai | ~17% of GigGuard workers |

Combined coverage: **100% of current GigGuard cities** with native-language support.

#### What Gets Translated

Not everything — translated badly is worse than untranslated. Phase 3 localises the surfaces that matter most to trust and comprehension:

**Tier 1 — Critical (all 5 languages, Phase 3):**
- Claim status messages: "Your claim is approved. ₹320 is being transferred to your UPI."
- Payout notifications: push notification text in the worker's language
- Under-review explanations: plain-language description of why a claim is being checked, written by a human for each language — not machine-translated
- Policy purchase confirmation: policy terms summary in local language
- Onboarding flow: registration form labels and helper text

**Tier 2 — Important (Hindi + Tamil first, then others):**
- Worker dashboard: all card labels, status badges, premium breakdown
- Buy policy flow: coverage amounts, trigger type names, formula explanation
- Claims history: trigger type labels, disruption reason descriptions

**Tier 3 — Nice to have (post-Phase 3):**
- Full legal policy document in regional languages
- In-app support chat in regional languages
- Email/SMS payout receipts in regional languages

#### AI-Powered Claim Explanations

The most technically interesting part of multilingual support is not translation — it is **generation**. When a claim is under review, a worker needs to understand why in plain, reassuring language. The reason is a structured object from the fraud scorer:

```json
{
  "flags": ["cell_tower_mismatch", "platform_offline_at_event"],
  "bcs_score": 34,
  "tier": 3
}
```

Translating `"cell_tower_mismatch"` to Tamil as செல் டவர் பொருந்தாமை is technically accurate and completely meaningless to a delivery worker. The Phase 3 approach generates the explanation in context using the ML service:

```
POST /ml-service/explain-claim-status
{
  "flags": ["cell_tower_mismatch", "platform_offline_at_event"],
  "language": "ta",
  "worker_name": "Priya"
}
→ "Priya, உங்கள் கோரிக்கை சரிபார்க்கப்படுகிறது. 
    நீங்கள் Swiggy-ல் offline ஆக இருந்தீர்கள் என்பதை நாங்கள் 
    கவனித்தோம். 4 மணி நேரத்தில் ஒரு மதிப்பாளர் தொடர்பு கொள்வார்."
```

This is generated once per flag combination per language and cached — not called at runtime per claim. The cache populates the first time a flag combination appears in that language.

#### Technical Implementation

**i18n library:** `next-intl` — Next.js native, file-based translation, no runtime overhead.

**Translation file structure:**
```
gigguard-frontend/
  messages/
    en.json    (source of truth)
    hi.json    (Hindi)
    ta.json    (Tamil)
    te.json    (Telugu)
    kn.json    (Kannada)
    mr.json    (Marathi)
```

**Language detection and selection:**
- Registration: worker selects preferred language during onboarding (stored on `workers.preferred_language`)
- Subsequent sessions: language loaded from worker profile via JWT claim
- Fallback: English if translation missing for a key (never shows a raw key)

**Translation workflow:**
- English strings authored by developers in `en.json`
- Professional human translation for Tier 1 critical strings (claim status, notifications)
- Machine translation (Google Translate API) for Tier 2 strings, reviewed by a native speaker before shipping
- Zero machine translation for legal or trust-critical content

**Schema change (one column):**
```sql
ALTER TABLE workers 
  ADD COLUMN preferred_language VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT 'en';
-- Values: 'en', 'hi', 'ta', 'te', 'kn', 'mr'
```

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ `next-intl` configured with cookie-based locale resolution
- ✅ `en.json` source of truth with 11 namespaces, 150+ keys
- ✅ `hi.json` fully translated (Tier 1 + Tier 2)
- ✅ `preferred_language` column + JWT claim + PATCH endpoint
- ✅ Language selector in registration flow + navbar dropdown
- ✅ Locale cookie synced on login/registration
- ✅ `check:translations` CI validation script
- ⏳ Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi Tier 1 strings pending professional translation
- ⏳ `POST /ml-service/explain-claim-status` endpoint planned for Phase 3 completion

---

Our platform is built on three pillars: automated triggers, fair pricing, and robust security.

### Parametric Triggers
This is the feature that enables automatic payouts. By defining clear, objective thresholds, we eliminate the ambiguity and paperwork of traditional claims. This is a game-changer for workers who cannot afford to wait for a manual review to be compensated for lost income.

| Trigger Type      | Data Source          | Threshold                 | Disruption Hours (Example) |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Heavy Rainfall    | OpenWeatherMap API   | > 15 mm/hr                | 4 hours                    |
| Severe AQI        | AQICN API            | > 300 (PM2.5)             | 5 hours                    |
| Extreme Heat      | OpenWeatherMap API   | > 44°C (Feels Like)       | 4 hours                    |
| Flood / Red Alert | IMD Mock RSS         | Alert Active for Zone     | 8 hours (Full Day)         |
| Curfew / Strike   | Mock Webhook         | Event Active for Zone     | 8 hours (Full Day)         |
| **Pandemic / Health Emergency** *(Phase 3)* | **MoHFW API + WHO RSS** | **Containment Zone declared in district** | **8 hours (Full Day)** |

> For detailed justifications, fraud guard mechanisms, and API parsing logic, see the [**Trigger Definitions Document**](docs/trigger-definitions.md).

### AI-Powered Premium Model
To ensure pricing is both fair and sustainable, our weekly premium is not a fixed number. It is calculated dynamically by a machine learning model that assesses risk in real-time. This means workers in lower-risk areas pay less, and prices adjust to reflect current forecasts.

**Formula:** `weekly_premium = base_rate × zone_multiplier × weather_multiplier × history_multiplier`

-   **Base Rate (₹35):** The fixed cost to cover basic operations.
-   **Zone Multiplier (AI-driven):** Reflects the long-term, historical risk of the worker's specific geographic zone.
-   **Weather Multiplier:** A short-term, forward-looking adjustment based on the 7-day weather and air quality forecast.
-   **History Multiplier:** A personal discount or surcharge based on the worker's individual claims history, rewarding safe behavior.

> For a complete breakdown of the formula and business viability analysis, see the [**Premium Model Document**](docs/Premium_model.docx).

### AI-Powered Fraud Detection
To protect the platform and keep premiums low, we use an **Isolation Forest** model to analyze claim patterns in real-time. This is an anomaly detection algorithm that excels at finding unusual behavior. It assigns a fraud score to each claim based on features like a worker's claim frequency compared to their zone's average. High-risk claims are flagged for a quick manual review, while legitimate claims are processed instantly.

## 5. 🛡️ Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing Strategy

> **Context:** A coordinated syndicate of 500 delivery workers has been found exploiting parametric insurance platforms using GPS-spoofing applications. Operating via Telegram groups, bad actors fake their location inside an active weather-alert zone while remaining safely at home, triggering mass false payouts. Simple GPS coordinate verification is no longer sufficient. This section details GigGuard's multi-layered, AI-driven defense architecture against this exact class of attack.

---

### 5.1 The Core Insight: GPS is a Claim, Not a Proof

The fundamental flaw in naive parametric systems is treating a GPS coordinate as ground truth. A GPS coordinate is a **self-reported claim** from a device. Our defense architecture is built on a single principle: **we never trust any single data signal in isolation.** Instead, we build a convergent evidence model — a claim is legitimate only when multiple independent, hard-to-fake signals agree.

A genuinely stranded delivery partner in a flood zone will produce a **coherent, physically consistent fingerprint** across every data layer. A bad actor spoofing their GPS from home will produce a **contradictory fingerprint** — their GPS says "flood zone," but their device's cellular tower, battery, accelerometer, and network behavior all say "couch."

---

### 5.2 Differentiation: Genuine Stranded Worker vs. GPS Spoofer

We differentiate using a **Behavioral Coherence Score (BCS)**, a composite ML-driven score (0–100) calculated at the moment a disruption event fires. A high BCS indicates a coherent, physically plausible signal. A low BCS triggers graduated review.

The BCS is computed from **four independent evidence layers**, each of which a spoofer must simultaneously defeat to appear legitimate:

#### Layer 1: Passive Telemetry Coherence (Device Signals)
The GigGuard mobile SDK passively collects lightweight telemetry throughout the workday — **not just at the moment of a claim event.** This creates a rich, continuous behavioral baseline that is impossible to retrospectively fake.

| Signal | What It Detects |
|---|---|
| **Accelerometer / Step Count** | A worker stranded in heavy rain shows near-zero movement. A spoofer sitting at home shows normal indoor movement (minor vibrations, occasional steps). Genuine stranding = stillness. |
| **Battery Drain Rate** | Using a GPS spoofing app in the foreground is computationally expensive. Devices running spoofers drain battery 30–50% faster than idle. A claimed "stranded" device with anomalously high battery drain is a red flag. |
| **Screen-On Time & App Usage** | A genuinely stranded worker in bad weather tends to have high screen-on time (checking maps, messaging family). A device passively spoofing in a pocket shows low screen activity. |
| **Network Cell Tower ID (CID)** | Every mobile carrier assigns a Cell ID to the tower a device is connected to. Cell tower locations are publicly mapped. If a device's GPS says it is in Dharavi (Zone 4) but its Cell ID resolves to a tower in Andheri (Zone 9), this is a **hard contradiction** that no GPS spoofer can mask without carrier-level access. |
| **Wi-Fi SSID & BSSID** | If a device is connected to a home Wi-Fi network (identifiable by BSSID hash), it is definitively not out in a severe weather event. A genuine stranded worker will be on mobile data or disconnected. |

> **Key architectural point:** The SDK is designed as a lightweight background service. It does not require constant active use. Workers consent to this telemetry during onboarding, and the data is stored locally on-device, with only the processed coherence signals (never raw data) sent to our servers on event trigger. This preserves privacy while enabling verification.

#### Layer 2: Geospatial Plausibility & Historical Trajectory
A real delivery worker has a **plausible physical journey** to be in a given location. Our backend maintains a rolling 48-hour GPS breadcrumb trail (hashed and anonymized for privacy).

-   **Pre-Event Trajectory Check:** When a disruption event fires, we verify that the worker's GPS coordinates over the preceding 2–4 hours show a coherent path *towards* or *within* the affected zone. A worker who teleports from their home pin to a flood zone 5 minutes before a trigger fires fails this check.
-   **Zone Dwell Time:** We require a minimum dwell time (e.g., 20+ minutes) within the affected zone before the trigger event, confirming the worker was already operating there, not just appearing at the moment of payout.
-   **Velocity Plausibility:** We flag any position delta that implies physically impossible speeds (e.g., jumping 15 km in 2 minutes), a classic telltale of GPS spoofing apps.

#### Layer 3: Platform Data Cross-Reference (The Delivery App Signal)
GigGuard is positioned as a B2B2C product, meaning policies are sold through partnerships with gig platforms (Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit). This unlocks our most powerful verification layer.

-   **Last Active Order Timestamp:** The partner platform can confirm whether the worker had accepted and was actively fulfilling an order at the time of the disruption event. A genuine stranded worker will have an open, active order. A spoofer sitting at home will be offline on the platform.
-   **Order Geofence Match:** The delivery address of the active order can be cross-referenced with the disruption zone. If a worker's last order destination falls inside the affected zone, it is a strong corroborating signal.
-   **Platform Online Status:** We verify the worker was in "online/available" status on the delivery platform within the 30-minute window before the event, confirming they were actively working, not resting at home.

> This cross-reference is the single most powerful anti-spoofing signal available to us. It requires the syndicate to not only spoof GPS but also to **actively be on-shift and accepting orders at scale**, which dramatically increases their operational cost and exposure risk.

#### Layer 4: Network & Graph-Level Anomaly Detection
Individual spoofing is detectable. Coordinated syndicate spoofing requires a network-level defense.

-   **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Fraud Ring Detection:** As outlined in our Innovation Plan, we model all workers, claims, and devices as a graph. In a legitimate disruption event, claimants will be a **diverse, organically distributed set** of workers who happen to be in the zone. A syndicate attack produces a **topologically unusual cluster**: workers who share network infrastructure (same IP subnet, same Wi-Fi BSSID group), have recently activated policies within a short time window, and show synchronized claim timing. The GNN flags these unnatural cluster formations.
-   **IP & Network Fingerprinting:** Multiple workers submitting claims originating from the same IP address or the same residential subnet is a direct indicator of a coordinated home-based spoofing operation.
-   **Claim Timing Entropy:** In a genuine disruption event, claims arrive over a distributed time window as workers realize they are stuck. In a coordinated attack, claims arrive in a tight, synchronized burst — a pattern that a simple time-series anomaly detector can identify.

---

### 5.3 The Data: What We Analyze Beyond GPS

The following table summarizes all data points our anti-spoofing system analyzes, their source, and their fraud signal:

| Data Point | Source | Fraud Signal |
|---|---|---|
| GPS Coordinates | Device (claimed) | Baseline — **never trusted alone** |
| Cell Tower ID (CID/LAC) | Mobile network (carrier-level, device-readable) | Hard contradiction if mismatches GPS zone |
| Wi-Fi BSSID | Device OS | Home Wi-Fi = hard "not stranded" signal |
| Accelerometer / Motion | Device IMU | No motion during "stranding" = coherent; normal motion = suspicious |
| Battery Drain Rate | Device OS | High drain = spoofer app running |
| Historical GPS Breadcrumb (48hr) | GigGuard backend | No plausible trajectory to zone = flag |
| Zone Dwell Time (pre-event) | GigGuard backend | < 20 min in zone before event = flag |
| Velocity Between Pings | GigGuard backend | Impossible speed = GPS spoof telltale |
| Platform Online Status | Gig platform API | Offline on platform = not working, cannot claim |
| Active Order at Event Time | Gig platform API | No open order = not genuinely stranded |
| Order Destination Zone | Gig platform API | Order not in disruption zone = mismatch |
| Claim IP Address | GigGuard backend | Shared IP with multiple claimants = coordinated |
| Network Subnet Clustering | GigGuard backend | Multiple claimants on same subnet = ring flag |
| Policy Activation Recency | GigGuard DB | Policy activated <48 hrs before first claim = fraud flag |
| Claim Timing Distribution | GigGuard backend | Synchronized burst timing = coordinated attack |
| GNN Cluster Score | ML Service | Unusual social/network graph cluster = ring detection |

### 5.4 The UX Balance: Protecting Honest Workers

The greatest risk of an aggressive fraud detection system is **false positives** — incorrectly flagging a legitimate worker who is genuinely stranded. In a severe weather event, network connectivity is degraded by definition. Cell signals drop. GPS accuracy suffers. Battery drains faster in cold or wet conditions. Our system is explicitly designed to account for all of this.

#### The Three-Tier Response Model

Rather than a binary "pay/deny" decision, we operate on three tiers:

**Tier 1 — Auto-Approve (BCS ≥ 70):**
The claim is coherent across multiple independent layers. Payout is executed instantly and automatically. This is the path for the vast majority of legitimate claims. Zero friction, zero delay. Workers in this tier never know the system ran a check.

**Tier 2 — Soft-Flag / Provisional Payout (BCS 40–69):**
One or two signals are ambiguous or missing (e.g., cell tower data unavailable due to network congestion, or platform API timed out). Crucially, **we issue a provisional payout immediately** — the worker is not penalized for a network outage during a storm. In parallel, the system queues a lightweight asynchronous verification. If verification confirms legitimacy (which it will for genuine workers), the record is cleared automatically. If verification fails (e.g., platform confirms worker was offline), the provisional payout is logged as a disputed transaction for human review before any recovery action is taken.

> **This is the key UX principle:** A genuine worker experiencing a network drop during a flood should not have to wait or fight for their payout. We pay first, verify second, and only escalate if hard contradictions emerge.

**Tier 3 — Hard-Flag / Manual Review (BCS < 40):**
Multiple strong contradictions are detected (e.g., home Wi-Fi connected + no platform activity + shared IP with 15 other claimants). The claim is held for a rapid human review — targeted to complete within 4 hours. The worker receives an in-app notification explaining that their claim is under a "quick verification check" with a transparent, plain-language status tracker. If review confirms fraud, the claim is denied and the syndicate node is reported. If review clears the worker, payout is issued with a small goodwill bonus (e.g., ₹20) to compensate for the inconvenience.

#### Safeguards Against System Error

-   **Weather-Adjusted Thresholds:** During an active Red Alert (our highest disruption tier), the BCS threshold for Tier 1 auto-approval is **lowered by 15 points** to account for the fact that severe weather will degrade network signals for everyone in the zone. We are more permissive, not less, during the events that matter most.
-   **Appeals Mechanism:** Every denied or held claim includes a one-tap appeal button in the app. The appeal surfaces a human reviewer within 2 hours and provides the worker with a simple checklist of evidence they can submit (e.g., a timestamped photo from their location).
-   **No Punitive History Impact:** A Tier 2 or Tier 3 flag that resolves in the worker's favor has zero impact on their History Multiplier (used in premium calculation). Only confirmed fraudulent claims affect future premiums.
-   **Syndicate Quarantine, Not Blanket Bans:** When a fraud ring is detected, we surgically flag the specific cluster of accounts, not entire zones. Legitimate workers in the same zone continue to receive auto-approved payouts without interruption.

### 5.5 Syndicate-Specific Countermeasures

The Telegram-coordinated syndicate model has specific structural weaknesses we exploit:

| Syndicate Tactic | GigGuard Counter |
|---|---|
| GPS spoofing app fakes location | Cell Tower ID hard-contradicts GPS; velocity anomaly detection flags impossible position jumps |
| Organize via Telegram, claim simultaneously | Synchronized claim burst timing detected; GNN flags social cluster |
| 500 workers, all from home | IP subnet clustering flags shared residential networks; platform offline status confirms no active work |
| Recruit new members, activate policies before event | Policy activation recency flag (< 48 hrs) elevates fraud score for new accounts |
| Scale attack across multiple events | Cross-event pattern learning: ML model raises fraud prior for accounts flagged in previous events |
| Spoof platform "online" status | Requires compromising the gig platform's API — outside the syndicate's capability; our B2B partnership provides tamper-evident status feeds |

---

### 5.6 Architectural Integration

The anti-spoofing system integrates into the existing GigGuard microservices architecture as an extension of the **ML Service**, with a new dedicated module:

```
Backend (Node.js)
  └── Trigger Monitor detects disruption_event
        └── For each affected policyholder:
              └── Calls ML Service /score-claim endpoint
                    ├── Pulls telemetry from Device SDK store
                    ├── Queries platform API for worker status
                    ├── Pulls 48hr breadcrumb from PostgreSQL
                    ├── Runs GNN cluster check
                    └── Returns { bcs_score, tier, flags[] }
              └── Backend routes to Tier 1 / 2 / 3 workflow
                    ├── Tier 1 → Razorpay instant payout
                    ├── Tier 2 → Provisional payout + async verify queue
                    └── Tier 3 → Hold + human review queue + worker notification
```

No new infrastructure is required. The existing ML Service (Python/Flask) and PostgreSQL database are extended. The device SDK is a new lightweight addition to the frontend mobile app, requiring a one-time worker consent during onboarding.

## 8. Setup and Running the Project

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.9+)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- `pnpm` (or `npm`/`yarn`)

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gigguard.git
cd gigguard
```

**2. Set up environment variables:**
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required API keys from OpenWeatherMap, AQICN, and Razorpay Sandbox.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**3. Install dependencies:**
```bash
# Install backend dependencies
pnpm install --prefix backend

# Install frontend dependencies
pnpm install --prefix gigguard-frontend

# Install ML service dependencies
pip install -r ml-service/requirements.txt
```

**4. Build and run services with Docker Compose:**
This is the recommended way to run the entire stack.
```bash
# From the root directory
docker compose up --build
```

If your project is inside OneDrive on Windows and Docker BuildKit fails with `invalid file request ...`, run Compose with the classic builder:
```powershell
$env:COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD='0'
$env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT='0'
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```

To make this permanent on Windows (so plain `docker compose up --build` works every time), run once and reopen terminal:
```powershell
setx COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD 0
setx DOCKER_BUILDKIT 0
```

**5. Access URLs:**
- **Frontend App:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API:** [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
- **ML Service:** [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)

**7. Consolidated Test Suite:**
We have hardened the testing infrastructure. All tests have been consolidated into the root `tests/` directory for better visibility.
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests (Requires DB + ML Service)
npm run test:integration

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```
Integration tests now automatically load environment variables from the root `.env` via `dotenv` in the setup script.
